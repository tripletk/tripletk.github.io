	                  I want to inform you that whenever you
	                  use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
	                  I collect data and information (through third party
	                  products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
	                  include information such as your device Internet Protocol
	                  (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the

	                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
	                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
	                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
	                  to your browser from the websites that you visit and are

	                </p> <p>
	                  This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
	                  the app may use third party code and libraries that use
	                  “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
	                  You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
	                  and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you

	                </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p>
	                  I may employ third-party companies and
	                  individuals due to the following reasons:
	                </p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
	                  I want to inform users of this Service
	                  that these third parties have access to your Personal
	                  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
	                  them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
	                  disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
	                </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
	                  I value your trust in providing us your
	                  Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
	                  acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
	                  of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
	                  storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
	                  guarantee its absolute security.

	                  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
	                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
	                  that these external sites are not operated by me.

	                  I do not knowingly collect personally
	                  identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
	                  I discover that a child under 13 has provided
	                  me with personal information, I immediately
	                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
	                  and you are aware that your child has provided us with
	                  personal information, please contact me so that
	                  I will be able to do necessary actions.

	                  periodically for any changes. I will

	    <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
	                  By downloading or using the app, these terms will
	                  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
	                  that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
	                  allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
	                  our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
	                  extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
	                  to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
	                  versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
	                  database rights and other intellectual property rights related

	                  Kaung Khant Kyaw is committed to ensuring that the app is
	                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
	                  reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
	                  its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never

	                  clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
	                </p> <p>
	                  The ABG/ABB Test app stores and processes personal data that
	                  you have provided to us, in order to provide my
	                  Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
	                  access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
	                  not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
	                  removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
	                  official operating system of your device. It could make your
	                  phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
	                  compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean

	                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
	                  Kaung Khant Kyaw will not take responsibility for. Certain
	                  functions of the app will require the app to have an active
	                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
	                  by your mobile network provider, but Kaung Khant Kyaw
	                  cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
	                  functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
	                  have any of your data allowance left.
	                </p> <p></p> <p>
	                  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
	                  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
	                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
	                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
	                  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
	                  other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
	                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
	                  charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
	                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
	                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
	                  using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
	                  received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
	                </p> <p>
	                  Along the same lines, Kaung Khant Kyaw cannot always take
	                  responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
	                  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
	                  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
	                  Kaung Khant Kyaw cannot accept responsibility.
	                </p> <p>
	                  With respect to Kaung Khant Kyaw’s responsibility for your
	                  use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
	                  bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
	                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
	                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
	                  to you. Kaung Khant Kyaw accepts no liability for any
	                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
	                  relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
	                </p> <p>
	                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
	                  currently available on iOS – the requirements for
	                  system(and for any additional systems we
	                  decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
	                  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
	                  using the app. Kaung Khant Kyaw does not promise that it
	                  will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
	                  and/or works with the iOS version that you have
	                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
	                  accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
	                  also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
