	                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
	                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
	                  commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent

	                  I want to inform users of this Service
	                  that these third parties have access to your Personal
	                  Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to

	                  This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
	                  a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
	                  that these external sites are not operated by me.
	                  Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the

	                  I do not knowingly collect personally
	                  identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
	                  I discover that a child under 13 has provided
	                  me with personal information, I immediately
	                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
	                  and you are aware that your child has provided us with
	                  personal information, please contact me so that
	                  I will be able to do necessary actions.

	                  time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
	                  periodically for any changes. I will
